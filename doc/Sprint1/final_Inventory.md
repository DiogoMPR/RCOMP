# Campus Final Inventory #

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The Campus consists in four distinct buildings. 
* The campus backbone (the starting point of all cables in the subsystem 3 is located in the Building 1 (where the Campus Distributor is located).
* Since the Campus Distributor is located in the building 1, there must be a connection via optic fiber cable between this and the other buildings on the campus.
* Prioritizing network security, we decided to connect the remaining campusÂ´s buildings to the Building 1 using two different cables along different routes, preventing the network from being compromised if one of the routes is destroyed.
