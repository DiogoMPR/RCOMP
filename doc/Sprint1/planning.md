### Specifications ###

* All backbone cables will be of optic fiber monomode 8 since it's immune to dispersion and thus allowing higher data rates.
* All the other ethernet network cables will be of category 7 (CAT7), since the performance is overall better than CAT6 and lower.
* CAT7 also have better shielding than CAT6 cables, making them more reliable and less susceptible to signal loss or disruption, 
this helps to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI).
* All cables will follow the 568B standard, since it´s the most common standard.

### Every team member should deliver a structured cabling deployment plan for the given building. ###
