### Relevant Justifications ###

#### Specifications ####

* The ground floor has an underfloor cable raceway connected to the external ditch.
* The acess to the underfloor cable raceway is available at points marked over the plan.
* Cable passageways to the above floor are also available.
* The ceiling height on this floor is 4 meters.
* Common areas (e.g. entrance hall, restrooms, room 4.0.12) require no network outlets.

#### Outlets ####

* The outlets distribution was made taking into account the most suitable locations so that the space room was not
  too compromised, also avoiding their placement too close to doors.
* When positioning the outlets, it was also considered that the maximum distance between them should be 3 meters, facilitating the connection to user´s equipment.
* The number of outlets per room was determined based on a proportion of 2 outlets for every 10 m2 of area, excluding room 4.0.2 .
* All outlets are placed on the walls, close to the floor.

#### Copper Cables ####

* All the copper cables are placed on the wall.

#### Access Points ####

* In this floor was installed two access point, in rooms 4.0.9 and 4.0.1 . 
* Each access point is responsible for managing an area of radio coverage around - called a cell. The maximum effective
  reach of the signal is roughly less than 30 meters, thus, in practice, the cell
  diameter is around 50 meters.
* 
#### Building Distributor (BD) ####

* The Building Distributor is located in the room 4.0.12.

#### Floor Distributor (FD) ####

* The floor distributor is located in the room 4.0.12.

#### Consolidation Points (CP) ####

* Due to the reduced number of outlets, there´s no need to use consolidation points.

#### Cable types used ####

* To connect the outlets to the Floor Distributor (FD) is used copper cable CAT7.
* To connect the Floor Distributor (FD) to the Building Distributor (floor 1) it was used optical fiber monomode 10, since it contributes to a most efficient and higher data transaction.

### Telecommunications enclosures ###

* Since there are 72 outlets in this floor, it's necessary to install two patch panels CAT7 with 48 ports each. This results in a size of 4U (2U for each patch panel).
* The enclosure will reach 6 times the U size for the patch panels, so that, the total size for this telecommunication enclosure will be 24U.
* Copper CAT7 patch cords required for each telecommunication enclosure equals the number of patch panel ports in each, meaning we need 96 short length patch cords.

## Total Inventory of Floor 0 ##

* In a fiber patch panel, each cable connection requires two fibres, so two connectors must be used.

### Relevant Justifications ###

#### Specifications ####

* The ceiling height on this floor is 3 meters, however there´s a removable dropped ceiling, placed 2.5 meters from the ground, covering the entire floor.
* The space over the ceiling is perfect to install cable raceways and wireless access-points.
* This floor has no underfloor cable raceways.
* Common areas (restrooms, and common areas like halls and corridors and rooms 4.1.19 and 4.1.20 ) require no network outlets.

#### Outlets ####

* The outlets distribution was made taking into account the most suitable locations so that the space room was not
  too compromised, also avoiding their placement close to doors.
* When positioning the outlets, it was also considered that the maximum distance between them should be 3 meters, facilitating the connection to user´s equipment.

#### Access Points ####

* In this floor was installed two access point, in 4.1.11 and 4.1.13.
* Each access point is responsible for managing an area of radio coverage around
  it called a cell. Due to emission power legal restrictions, the maximum effective
  reach of the signal is roughly less than 30 meters, thus, in practice, the cell
  diameter is around 50 meters.


#### Floor Distributor (FD) ####

* The floor distributor is located in the room 4.1.19.

#### Consolidation Points (CP) ####

### Telecommunications enclosures ###

* Since there are 120 outlets in this floor, it's necessary to install three patch panels CAT7 with 48 ports each. This results in a size of 6U (2U for each patch panel).
* The enclosure will reach 6 times the U size for the patch panels, so that, the total size for this telecommunication enclosure will be 36U.
* Copper CAT7 patch cords required for each telecommunication enclosure equals the number of patch panel ports in each, meaning we need 144 short length patch cords.

## Total Inventory of Floor 1 ##

* In a fiber patch panel, each cable connection requires two fibres, so two connectors must be used.
