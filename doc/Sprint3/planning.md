## 2. Specifications ##

* The team use the Packet Tracer version 8.2.1.0118.

* The main output is the Packet Tracer simulation file for the corresponding building, it should be named BuildingN.pkt, with N being the number which identifies the building.

* The team member is charge of building 2 has the additional final subtask of integrating all members work for this sprint into a single final overall simulation (campus.pkt).

### 2.1. OSPF area ids

| **OSPF area id** |  **area**  |
|:----------------:|:----------:|
|        0         |  Backbone  |
|        1         | Building 1 |
|        2         | Building 2 |
|        3         | Building 3 |
|        4         | Building 4 |

### 2.2. VoIP prefixes

| **Building** | **Prefix** |
|:------------:|:----------:|
|  Building 1  |     1      |
|  Building 2  |     2      |
|  Building 3  |     3      |
|  Building 4  |     4      |

### 2.3. DNS names

* The highest level DNS domain will be part of Building 1, naming rcomp-23-24-dd-g2. It will be used as if it was the DNS root domain.

* The other DNS domains will be created locally in each building, naming building-X.rcomp-23-24-dd-g2. The letter X will identify the building's number.

* In each building, all DNS servers will have the unqualified DNA name as ns. While Building 1 will have ns.rcomp-23-24-dd-g2, the others will have ns.building-X.rcomp-23-24-dd-g2.

#### 2.3.1. IPv4 node address for each DNS name server

|  **Building**  |            **Name**             | **DMZ name** |  **address**   |
|:--------------:|:-------------------------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
| **Building 1** |      ns.rcomp-23-24-dd-g2       |    B1-DMZ    |  172.22.108.0  |
| **Building 2** | ns.building-2.rcomp-23-24-dd-g2 |    B2-DMZ    | 172.22.98.128  |
| **Building 3** | ns.building-3.rcomp-23-24-dd-g2 |    B3-DMZ    | 172.22.103.128 |
| **Building 4** | ns.building-4.rcomp-23-24-dd-g2 |    B4-DMZ    | 172.22.107.128 |
